//! Record and process traces.
//!
//! "Tracing" is split into the following stages:
//!
//! 1. *Record* the trace with a [Tracer], which abstracts over a specific *tracer backend*. The
//!    tracer backend may use one of several low-level tracing methods (e.g. a hardware tracer like
//!    PT or a software tracer). The tracer backend stores the recorded low-level trace in an
//!    internal format of its choosing.
//! 2. *Process* the recorded trace. The tracer backend returns an iterator which produces
//!    [TraceAction]s.
//! 3. *Compile* the processed trace. That happens in the [compile](crate::compile) module.
//!
//! This module thus contains tracing backends which can record and process traces.
